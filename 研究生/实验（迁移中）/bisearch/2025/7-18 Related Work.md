\paragraph{Tar-aware deduplication approaches.}

Several studies have explored deduplication tailored to specific data formats and workloads. For virtual machine images, Jin et al. \cite{jin09} propose content-aware chunking that exploits the structure of virtual disk formats. Xu et al. \cite{xu17} design database-aware deduplication that leverages database page boundaries. Most relevant to our work is mtar \cite{lin2015metadata}, which reorganizes tar archives by relocating header blocks to improve deduplication effectiveness. However, mtar only addresses chunk-based deduplication and does not exploit the rich metadata embedded in tar archives for delta compression. In contrast, \sysname leverages tar metadata for both improved chunking (semantic-aware chunking) and enhanced resemblance detection (hybrid approach), achieving substantially better storage efficiency through fine-grained deduplication.

  

\paragraph{Fine-grained deduplication techniques.}

Traditional fine-grained deduplication relies on feature-based approaches to identify similar chunks for delta compression. Earlier studies \cite{} generate features based on Rabin fingerprints over chunk contents. Finesse \cite{zhang19} mitigates the computational overhead of calculating Rabin fingerprints via fine-grained locality within similar chunks. DeepSketch \cite{park22} improves the accuracy of base chunk search based on deep learning with specialized hardware. Odess \cite{zou21} optimizes feature generation through content-defined subsets and N-Transform algorithms. However, all these approaches rely solely on content features and often overlook similar chunks when content changes significantly, as they are sensitive to data modifications that alter the generated features \cite{park22, sun24}. \sysname introduces a complementary metadata-based approach that exploits pathname information embedded in tar archives, enabling more reliable identification of similar chunks even when feature-based methods fail. It also implements an adaptive mechanism that dynamically switches between metadata-based and feature-based approaches based on compression effectiveness, addressing the limitation of static approaches.

  

\paragraph{Chunking strategies for structured data.}

Content-defined chunking (CDC) has been extensively studied to address the boundary-shift problem in traditional fixed-size chunking. FastCDC \cite{xia16} optimizes CDC performance through gear-based rolling hash and normalized chunking. However, CDC still suffers from boundary shifts in structured data formats. Some studies propose application-aware chunking strategies: DARE \cite{xu17} aligns chunk boundaries with database record boundaries, while other work \cite{liu19} exploits log entry structures. Unlike these static chunking strategies that apply uniform approaches across all data, \sysname implements semantic-aware chunking with different strategies for different semantic components within tar archives (header chunks for metadata, file chunks for small files, and CDC chunks for large files), ensuring both structural alignment and fine-grained deduplication effectiveness.

  

\paragraph{Performance improvements for delta compression.}

Recent studies explore fast delta compression that trades storage savings for performance. MeGA \cite{zou22} uses selective delta compression to avoid loading containers with only a few base chunks, but it significantly degrades storage savings. LoopDelta \cite{zhang23} proposes inverse delta compression by treating new data chunks as base chunks and delta-compressing old base chunks with respect to the new data chunks. However, LoopDelta does not address the I/O overhead when reconstructing data chunks that are originally delta-compressed with respect to old base chunks, and only considers plain data reduction without addressing specific data format characteristics like tar archives that \sysname targets.
